# Image Gen Draft

## Warm Up (5 min)

**Prompt:**

1. Turn to a partner
2. Count down from 5, and at the count of 1, both call out the name of an animal
3. For 1 minute, each draw a mix of those 2 animals
4. Compare your images -- what details are similar and what are different?
5. Share your images with another partnership -- can they guess what the prompt was?

**Discuss:** Debrief with the students what they found while comparing images. Feel free to take only 1-2 responses and not dwell on this as a class; students should have already discussed with each other

**Remarks:** You all just created animals that didn't exist before you drew them. Increasingly, AI can do this sort of thing as well! Does that mean it's creative? Through this lesson, we'll explore _how_ AI builds these new images, so we can answer this question

## Activity (35 minutes)

### Show the Video (20 min)

**Video** Show the first part of the How AI Works: Chatbots and Large Language Models video. At key points throughout (described below) we will be pausing the video to give students a chance to synthesize their understanding.

**Vocabulary**

* **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)** - a way of using two competing AI models to generate something.
* **Diffusion AI -** converting an image to noise, and training an AI to reverse the process.

### Explore Diffusion (15 min)

**Remarks:** There are lots of different ways to create noise in an image. For this activity, we'll explore what you can see in an image with different levels of noise.\
\
Then, we'll guess other people's images based on what we can see at different levels of noise.

**Distribute**: Hand out the Noisy Image activity Guide

**Model:** Show how to use the Noisy Image Widget.

**Code Studio:** Have students log into code studio and interact with the widget

**Circulate:** Help student stay on task, guessing things about their images

**Regroup:** Have students regroup for a synthesis discussion

**Discuss:** What did you notice during this activity?\
**Follow-up (if necessary)** Were you able to see details in the noisy images? Did you see more details once you knew the original image?

**Discussion Goal:** This discussion helps students synthesize what they were learning, and connect it back to the video on diffusion models finding details.

## Wrap-Up (5 min)

**Discuss:** Are diffusion models _creative?_ Why or why not?

**Discussion Goal:** Students may have very different answers to this question. Some may think diffusion models are creative because they create things that have never been made before from prompts. Others will note that it's only re-creating details it has seen before in new configurations
